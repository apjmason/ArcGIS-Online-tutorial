They were really light ones that would happen a couple times a year, and then they started fracking really severly. There were like really severe earthquakes that would happen, like weekly. And then all of the oil companies denied it saying like “It’s not fracking. Correlation is not causation” kind of thing. So that’s a very present thing. Also it’s a huge social issue because eventually the earthquakes are gonna get bigger if they don’t stop. And none of the insurance companies in Oklahoma cover earthquakes. Because it’s never been a problem in the state. So if there’s damage no one’s gonna have their homes covered.""",Oklahoma,Home,Oklahoma as a state,OK,US,35,-97.09
