<em>ArcGIS is an industry-standard tool developed by geographers in the 1970s. As digital historians have pursued more complex and large-scale spatial analysis projects, ArcGIS is a tool frequently used to visualize and analyze spatial data. The ArcGIS Online platform is featured in many digital mapping projects) allows data analyzed and visualized in ArcGIS to be interactive and publicly-accessible.</em>

## Customizing Your Map

The default setting for ArcGIS Online is to display the locations in your data without any styling or customization. Hover your cursor over the data layer to see additional customization options. You can use multiple layers to display or highlight different aspects of the data on the map.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-63 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-Online-tutorial/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_10.PNG?raw=true" alt="Capture_10"  /></p>

### Basemap

You can change the background map by click a different option in the Basemap dropdown.

<p align="center"><img class=" wp-image-66 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-Online-tutorial/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_13.PNG?raw=true" alt="Capture_13" /></p>

### Legend

If you want to style points by location, emotion, or another attribute, click on the Change Style icon. Choose an element from your data, and explore the drawing style options.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-69 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-Online-tutorial/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_16.png?raw=true" alt="Capture_16"  /></p>

Hover your cursor over the data layer and click the three dots that appear.

Click on the Configure Pop-up option to select what data fields display in the pop-up window that appears when you click on a map point. You can also reorder these elements.

### Other options

Hover your cursor over the data layer and click the three dots that appear to see additional options for customizing transparency, copying a layer, or naming a layer.

<hr />

14-Work as a group to explore display options for your data. One layer does not have to communicate all relevant aspects of the data.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-65 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-Online-tutorial/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_12.png?raw=true" alt="Capture_12" /></p>

15-Once you have a layer customized, you can copy that layer to continue exploring other display options without losing the customized layer.

16-Rename layers using descriptive titles to keep them organized.

## Working With Polygon Data

Up to this point, we have been working with geospatial data that includes points with specific latitude and longitude. But, in many cases a specific point is not the most effective or accurate spatial representation. For example, data that covers an entire district, region, or state will not be effectively represented by a single map point.

In such cases, we need to be working with polygon, rather than point, geospatial data.

As described on [ArcGIS's website](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/core-concepts/features-and-geometries/), "Points define a single location on the map, such as a user's location...Polygons define closed shapes, such as the outline of a lake."

We'll be using a layer of polygons that includes Iowa School District boundaries.

### Adding Polygons to a Web Map

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-65 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-Online-tutorial/blob/HUM297/screenshots/Capture_aa.png?raw=true" alt="Capture_12" /></p>

18- Navigate to [Iowa School District layer in ArcGIS Online](http://arcg.is/C4TzS).


<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-65 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-Online-tutorial/blob/HUM297/screenshots/Capture_bb.png?raw=true" alt="Capture_12" /></p>

19- Click on the Data menu link to look at the back-end data for the polygon layer.

20- Notice the DE_DIST data field contains unique identifiers that match the District Number field in the District Enrollment CSV file we've been using. We'll eventually use those matching identifiers to connect the enrollment data to the district polygon data.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-65 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-Online-tutorial/blob/HUM297/screenshots/Capture_cc.png?raw=true" alt="Capture_12" /></p>

25- Choose the district polygon layer as the target layer, and the district enrollment CSV file as the layer to join to the target layer.

26- Select the option to join the layers based on a matching field, and select the DE_DIST field from the polygon layer and the DISTRICT NUMBER field from the CSV layer.

27- Make sure Join One to One is selected under Choose join operations.

28- Give the Result layer name a descriptive title.

29- Click the Run Analysis button to join the two layers.


## Adding Other Data Layers

30- One of the benefits of working with ArcGIS Online is the option to add additional data layers that other users have published and shared to the web.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-65 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-Online-tutorial/blob/HUM297/screenshots/Capture_oo.png?raw=true" alt="Capture_12" /></p>

# Design Brainstorm

## Group roles

SCRIBE
- One member of the group is the primary scribe (taking notes, shared documentation), others add details as needed

TIME KEEPER
- A second member of the group is responsible for keeping track of time/staying on task

PRESENTER
- A third member of the group is responsible for sharing your research plan/proposal with the larger group

## Step 1 (5 minutes)

Take 5 minutes to explore the Iowa School District Enrollment data with your group.

- What types of data are represented?
- What questions do you have about this data?
- What is not accounted for in this data?

## Step 2 (7 minutes)

Working as a group, explore what types of research questions could you ask of this data, or what stories could you tell with this data.

Decide what aspects of the data you will need to focus on to address your research question or topic focus.

Brainstorm what other kinds of data you might want to include to respond to your research question.

## Step 3 (15 minutes)

Work as a group to build and customize an ArcGIS Online Web Map that responds to your reserach question or topic focus.

## Step 4 (5 minutes per group)

Share your group's work with the larger group.

Present your analysis and visualizations, but also reflect on your process of developing a research focus and engaging with the data. 

Questions to consider when sharing out:
<ul>
 	<li>What aspects of the data are highlighted?</li>
 	<li>What does your interactive map communicate about the data?</li>
 	<li>What could a user learn from your interactive map?</li>
 	<li>Other ideas for how you might want to design or continue building the interactive map?</li>
</ul>
